# Assembly Of Casing

### Removal Of Support Structures

:::tip Be Careful!
The material can be sharp and so it is recommended to wear gloves or to be cautious when removing the structure.
:::

1. The support structure is generally easy to remove for most models. However, the side support beams of the Main Body part can be a little tricky. First, you will need a set of long nose pliers to crush the supports horizontally.

2. Continue crushing the supports until the structure feels loose. Push the structure out with your fingers. If it is still very difficult to push, continue crushing the support.

3. The support structure should come out quite easily if it is adequately loosened. Repeat for the other side.

4. Sometimes it will help if you completely crush the structure into many pieces before removing them.

### Assembly Of Main Body

**You will need:**

- 1x Raspberry Pi / Touch Display assembly
- 4x M3 8mm bolts
- 1x 1/4" 5mm nut
- 1x Camera Tripod Adaptor Screw

**Tools needed:**

- Screw driver
- (optional) Long nose pliers
- Delicate hands

1. Before you start, please separate the parts as such:

2. Insert the Raspberry Pi and screen assembly from the front of the Main Body, fitting the Raspberry Pi into the opening.

3. Align the screw holes and tie the Main Body with the Raspberry Pi assembly using 4 M3 8mm bolts.

5. Insert the 1/4" nut into the octagonal slot.

9. From below the model, insert the tripod mount adaptor screw and tie it into the 1/4" nut.

10. The assembly is complete. For input cables, the wiring should go through the hole below the Raspberry Pi.

### Assembly Of Camera Mount

**You will need:**

- 1x HD Camera
- 1x Camera Mount
- 4x M2.5 10mm bolts
- 4x M2.5 nuts
- (optional for the assembly step) 1x Camera lens

**Tools needed:**

- Screw driver
- (optional) Long nose pliers
- Delicate hands

Before you start, please disassemble the camera into the following parts

![Camera Mount Assembly 1](../../../static/img/assembly/camassem-1.jpg)

1. Insert 4 M2.5 10mm bolts into the 4 screw holes from the inner side of the camera mount.

   ![Camera Mount Assembly 2](../../../static/img/assembly/camassem-2.jpg)

   ![Camera Mount Assembly 3](../../../static/img/assembly/camassem-3.jpg)

2. While the bolts are in place, align the camera to the back outer side of the camera mount

:::tip Tip:
The bolts in the image here is defying gravity for illustration purposes only. Please assemble the mount in a way that feels comfortable for you. I recommend using a screwdriver to hold the bolts in place as you insert each side of the camera into the bolt.

How it should look like from the inside

3. Place the nuts over all the bolts and hand screw it into the bolt until it is able to keep the bolts in place.

4. To secure it tightly, use a screwdriver to turn the bolt while you hold the nut with your fingers.

5. Once all the bolts are tightened, the setup should look like this

6. The camera lens can now be inserted through the front of the assembly.

### Full Assembly

1. Prepare the camera assembly by removing the lens (if the lens is installed). Insert an M3 10mm bolt from the inside of the camera assembly as shown in the image.
