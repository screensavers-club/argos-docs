4. With the touch screen display on the front of the main body part, facing outward, align the screw holes of the touch screen display brackets with the inner mount.

The USB C port should be facing downwards.

2. While the bolts are in place, align the camera to the back outer side of the camera mount

:::tip Tip:
The bolts in the image here is defying gravity for illustration purposes only. Please assemble the mount in a way that feels comfortable for you. I recommend using a screwdriver to hold the bolts in place as you insert each side of the camera into the bolt.

3. Place the nuts over all the bolts and hand screw it into the bolt until it is able to keep the bolts in place.
