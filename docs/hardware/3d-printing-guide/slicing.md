# Slicing

We used [Simplify 3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/) to slice our models. However, you can use any slicer you feel comfortable with as long as you use similar settings.

1. Once the files are downloaded, open up Simplify3D.

2. Drag the file you wish to print into the print bed.

3. Press "ctrl + L" to activate "face selection mode".

4. Select the face you wish to be the base of the model. In this case, we selected the front face of the main body as it will result in the most efficient print.

5. Press "ctrl + R" to center the model. Alternatively, you may manually drag the model to a desired part of the print bed.

6. Under the "Processes" section, select your desired process (will explain more in the next step). If this section is empty, click the "Add" button below to add a process.

7. You should see this window appear. This is your printer settings. For this print, we are using "PLA", print on "Medium" quality, with 15% infill. Make sure you have "Generate Support" checked.

:::tip Tip
You may use your own settings as well! These are just the recommended settings as we have been using these settings for the prototypes.

:::warning Note
As all printers are different, there are many printer default settings that you do not need to change or follow. The only things you should take note are: material, quality, supports, infills, temperature. Everything else you may leave as default.

8. You may change the infill settings under the "Infill" tab.

9. Under the "Temperature" tab, ensure that the temperature is suitable for your printing material. As we are using PLA, our setting is 60 degrees for print bed, 200 degrees for extruder.

10. Once you are done setting, close the window and click "Prepare to Print!".

11. The computer will render the model with generated supports. You may check if there are errors, but generally this is alright.

12. You can also check the build time and filament used under the "Build Statistics" section.

13. You can then save the file into your SD Card by clicking on "Save Toolpaths to Disk".

:::tip Note
If there is an error stating that the path cannot be accessed or is restricted, check if the card is on "locked" (down) position. Push the tab up to unlock it, if so.
