# 4e. Known Issues

3D Printing has its issues. Here are some that we found. Note, our fixes may only be specific to our own setup, and as such, please check online for any generic fixes first before trying ours.

**Issue 1: The 3D model is printed weak or flakey.**

Fix: This is usually caused by under-extrusion. The 3D printer is is not extruding properly, usually due to stuck nozzle or the nozzle is pressing against the print bed, blocking the filament from extruding.

To fix this issue, try lowering the print bed first. A rule of thumb is to slide a piece of paper below the nozzle and the contact point. If the paper slides with some resistance, it is ok.

If this doesn't fix the issue, check if the nozzle is clogged. There are a few tutorials online that teaches you to unclog filaments which may be specific to your printer. Some methods include using an **acupuncture needle** to unclog the nozzle hole, or to do the **cold-pull method**.

**Issue 2: Stuck filament**

Fix: Depending on the 3D printer, there are different areas where the filament gets stuck. There are multiple factors.

1. The filament is old (or is of bad quality) and is breaking inside the tubing. Remove all the filament inside the tubing and change out a new filament.

2. The filament is not aligned with the extruder exit. When this happens, open up the extruder (or get a clear view of the extruder exit) and try to guide the filament out.

3. The nozzle is clogged. In this case, heat up the nozzle until about 240 degrees to 260 degrees. This will melt all the PLA inside the nozzle. Try pushing filament in to force the clogged material out from the nozzle end. If this does not work, try inserting an acupuncture needle into the nozzle end.

**Issue 3: Model Sticking Too Hard Onto Printing Bed**

Fix: This is usually due to the nozzle from being too low, causing spreading the extruded filament too thin such that it becomes smoother and more surface area to stick onto the bed. The fix is to raise the nozzle up, but not too high such that the filament comes out stringy.

If this still does not stick, we recommend buying masking tapes or non-stick printing bed mats to stick onto the printing bed.

**Issue 4: Printed Material Not Extruding At Some Parts Of The Bed**

Fix: Usually, this is due to the levelling of the printer. Over time, the levelling of printer gets changed due to the print bed springs loosening. Try doing a new round of calibration.

A good way to check if the printer is properly levelled is to slide a piece of paper below the nozzle and print bed when you're calibrating. Level the bed to the point where the nozzle is pressing onto the paper, but still allows the paper to be slid around.
