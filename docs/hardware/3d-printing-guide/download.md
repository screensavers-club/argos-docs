## The 3D Model

![Full Model 1](../../../static/img/v3-2/3-2-1.png)

The full model takes approximately 20-30 hours to print, depending on the 3D printer.

The model consists of 3 parts:

- The main body which bears the weight of entire setup and keeps it upright.
- The front cover which protects the screen and provide extra stability.
- The backplate which protects the electronics.

The full 3D model includes the electronics components for reference.
