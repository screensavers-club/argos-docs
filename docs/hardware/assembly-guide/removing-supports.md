# Removing Supports

Once the model is done printing, the first step is always to remove the supports. You will need your **pliers**.

### Removal Of Support Structures

:::danger Be Careful!
The material can be sharp, becareful not to cut yourself.
:::

1. First, pop out the flimsier supports found at the bottom of the main body case.

2. Remove the smaller support at the front of the model

3. For the side supports (inside the beams), if the support structure is weak enough, you may use your fingers to pop the supports out.

7. For the tripod mount screw and nut area, use a plier to simply pull the support out from the nut side.
