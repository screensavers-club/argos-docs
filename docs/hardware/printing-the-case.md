# Printing The Case

This section tells you what to do to print the files

## Download the files

[Rhino file of all parts](https://github.com/screensavers-club/argos-childnode-case/tree/main/1.0/rhino#:~:text=0106_argos%20camera%20mount.3dm)

## The 3D Model

![Full Model 1](../../static/img/3d-models/full-model-1.png)
![Full Model 2](../../static/img/3d-models/full-model-2.png)
![Full Model 3](../../static/img/3d-models/full-model-3.png)

The model consists of 3 parts:

- The inner touchscreen display mount which holds the touchscreen in an upright position
- The camera mount which holds the camera
- The outer case which holds all the components together

The full 3D model includes the electronics components for reference.

## 3D Printing: Setting Up

We used [Simplify 3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/) to slice our models. However, you can use any slicer you feel comfortable with as long as you use similar settings.

:::tip Note
Ensure your 3D printer is big enough to print the case.

Here are the properties we use for the printing

:::tip Note
Place the models in ways which generates the least amount of supports.

Once sliced, you can print the files.
