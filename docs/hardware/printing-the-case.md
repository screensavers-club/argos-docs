# Printing The Case

This section tells you what to do to print the files.

The latest version of the model is Version 2.1.

## Download the files

The model consists of 2 parts:

- The main body which bears the weight of entire setup and keeps it upright.
- The camera mount which holds the camera

The full 3D model includes the electronics components for reference.

## 3D Printing: Setting Up

We used [Simplify 3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/) to slice our models. However, you can use any slicer you feel comfortable with as long as you use similar settings.

:::tip Note
Ensure your 3D printer is big enough to print the case. A minimum of 200mm by 200mm print bed is recommended.

Here are the properties we use for the printing

:::tip Note
Place the models in ways which generates the least amount of supports.

Once sliced, you can print the files.
