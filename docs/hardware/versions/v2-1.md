### Issues

1. The slot for the wires is not aligned to the new position of where the wires connect to the Raspberry Pi. This needs to be fixed in the next variation.

**Feedback from TTP**

1. Camera area is a bit fragile. Will have to work on a sturdier option with an open design.

2. Tripod mount on camera side cannot fit into the case. Need to lower the camera mount base on the main body side

3. Camera lens knob is hitting onto the base of the camera mount as there is no space or slots provided for that movement.

4. Cannot pluyg in HDMI cable as it is blocked by the tripod mount screw area. (see issue #1)

5. Tripod screw thread is too short and cannot thread through the nut. Need to lower the height of that particular part.
