**Version 3.0 features:**

- Better 3D model redone from scratch. Everything now fits with one another properly with lesser possibility of having bad surfaces.
- Overall fixes based on feedback.
- Raised the bottom of the model to prevent the wire from bending too much and causing the model to topple
- Added containers that can be filled with heavy objects to weigh down the model.
- Added flat surface at the sides of the main body to allow the model to be weighted down.
- Further opened up the camera mount area on the main body to allow better access of camera and lens
- Camera area is now raised enough such that the adjustment knob do not hit the model. (but still will hit in some cases (see issue #1))
- Camera lens now rests on the model using the mount screw below it, making it easier to move the camera around.
- Redesigned camera mount to just be an optional piece that supports the camera
- Added a prototype front cover slot that protects the screen. This is still a work in progress.
- Opened up more space at the bottom of the model to allow for the cables to fit better.

### Issues

1. The camera lens knob may still hit the model at the front "cover" area.

2. The camera mount did not work, and will be moved to be part of the backplate in future iterations

3. The front cover fits well, but require ways to tie down.

4. The tripod mount area looks weak, will need to strengthen. Also, it's still blocking the wires as it is protruded out.
