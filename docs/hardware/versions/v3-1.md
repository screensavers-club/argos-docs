**Other notes**

The long-time problem of camera knob hitting the model is solved!

### Issues

1. The snap design of the front cover is weak and snaps off very easily.

2. The beams at the back of the model is a bit too thick for any of the screws we got to go through. In order to note waste bought resources, as well as save some material cost, the beams will be thinned. Hopefully this does not cause any structural problems (very unlikely)
