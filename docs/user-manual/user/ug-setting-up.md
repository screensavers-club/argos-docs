# 1. Setting Up The Assembled Unit

The items required for the case assembly is:

- Fully assembled Child Node Unit
- Raspberry Pi Power Cable
- Optional: Audio jack
- Optional: Micro HDMI Cable (If external screen is used)

Tools to use:

- Optional: Keyboard
- Optional: Mouse

1. Plug in and ensure the security of all the components (i.e. camera, lenses, microphone) you need before starting up the Raspberry Pi.

:::warning Note

If you are swapping out or installing the camera lens, please check if the **C-CS Adaptor** is attached onto the camera. Check if your lens require this adaptor before installation as it will cause focusing issues.

Please check this [issue](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=276558) and this [documentation](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/product-guides/Typical_C-Mount_Lens_Guide.pdf) to understand more about this issue.

2. Attach the power cable onto the **Raspberry Pi** via the **USB C port**

3. Plug the power plug into an inlet to power the **Raspberry Pi**

:::tip Note
The image shown below uses the US power plug. We are using an adaptor with it as we are using the UK powerpoint.

:::tip Note
Be careful to not remove or attach any wiring while the device is powered as it may cause short circuit which may damage the components. If you have to re-configure any wiring, please shut down and unplug the Raspberry Pi before doing so. Please note that this does not apply when switching camera lenses.

4. A red light should appear on the Raspberry Pi, indicating that it is booting up. Wait until you see the desktop.

5. The latest version of the Argos Child Node should have a desktop shortcut included that will bring you directly to the Child Node software. Please use that to launch the Child Node. Alternatively, you may click the **globe icon** at the top left of the screen. This will launch the web browser, **Chromium** which will have Argos Child set as default home page.

6. Alternatively, you may type in the URL: `https://argos-child.vercel.app/`. To do this, you will need to either **plug in a keyboard** or use the on-screen keyboard via clicking the `Raspberry Pi Icon` on the top left of the top bar, then clicking `Accessories` > `Keyboard`.
