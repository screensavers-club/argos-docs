3. For the side supports (inside the beams), if the support structure is weak enough, you may use your fingers to pop the supports out.

6. Use hands to remove the rest of the support once it is crushed as it is easier to do so.

7. For the tripod mount screw and nut area, use a plier to simply pull the support out from the top.

   ### Front Cover

8. There are support structures on the front cover as well. Use pliers to pull them out from the screw holes.

9. There are supports behind the hooks at the top of the front cover as well. It is important to remove this as the front cover may not fit onto the main body without removing this support.
