# Lens Adjustment: Exposure and Focus

The camera lens should come with two dials: one for **focusing**, and one for controlling the **exposure**. Due to the complexity of how the lens work, it is recommended to follow through the next set of instructions step-by-step to avoid confusion.

Here are some reference images for the instructions below.

## Exposure

Locate the dial that is responsible for **exposure** **(see the pink arrow in the reference image)**.

Adjust the exposure to get the desired brightness you require for your performance. Lock the dial in place by tightening the **extended knob** found 1 level before the dial **(see the green arrow in the reference image)**.

:::tip Note
If you find it hard to adjust the dial, try loosening the extended knob and try again.

## Focus

Ensure that the exposure knob is tightened before you begin focusing. This is to ensure that you do not accidentally adjust the exposure.

Locate the dial responsible for the **focus** adjustment **(see the yellow arrow in the reference image)**.

To adjust the camera's focus, turn the dial **clockwise** to focus on further objects, and **anti-clockwise** to focus on nearer objects. Adjust until you see a sharp image.
