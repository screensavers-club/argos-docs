# Camera and Lens Configuration

## Testing your camera

First, remove the lens cap from the XIMI camera module.

To test your camera, tap on the **Test Cam** button. You should see the image your camera is currently capturing.

## Lens Adjustment: Exposure and Focus

If you see a blank image, ensure that the lens cap is taken off. If the image is still blank, consider this troubleshooting solution: [Camera fails to turn on after OS upgrade](/docs/user-manual/performers/troubleshooting/camera/camera-doesnt-turn-on-after-os-upgrade).

The camera lens should come with two dials: one for **focusing**, and one for controlling the **brightness**. **Due to the complexity of how the lens work, it is recommended to follow through the next set of instructions step-by-step to avoid confusion.**

Here is a reference image for the instructions below. Take note that there are 3 sections labelled #1, #2, and #3. We will use these numbers to guide you through the setup below.

Note: If your unit do not have any **extended pins (image below)**, please [contact us here](/docs/help-problem).

If your unit have **only 1 extended pin**, you can use it to **lock the exposure dial**, as it is preferable to lock the exposure dial to make it easier to rotate the focus dial. If your pin is at **#3**, remove and insert the pin into the threaded hole at **#2**.

:::info Note

Before adjusting the dials, ensure that all **extended pins (on #2 and #3)** are **untightened (but not removed from the lens)**. This ensures that you are able to rotate the dials easily.
:::

### Brightness

The camera lens allows you to adjust the brightness of the image.

Locate the dial at **#1** and adjust to get the desired brightness you require for your performance.

Next, lock the dial in place by **tightening** the **extended pin** at **#2**

:::tip Note
If you find it hard to adjust the dial, **try loosening the extended knob at #2 and try again.**
:::

### Focus

The second control on the camera lens is focus.

:::info Note
Ensure that **the brightness dial is locked before you begin focusing**. **#1** should be rotating together with **#2** at this point. If this is not happening, please tighten the extended knob at **#2**. This is to ensure that you do not accidentally change the brightness. If you have not done so, please refer to the [Brightness section](/docs/user-manual/performers/lens-setup#brightness).
:::

Locate the dial at **#2**. To adjust the focus, turn the dial **clockwise** to focus on further objects, and **anti-clockwise** to focus on nearer objects. Adjust until you see a sharp image.

Next, lock the dial in place by **tightening** the **extended pin** at **#3**

:::tip Note
If you find it hard to adjust the dial, **try loosening the extended knob at #3 and try again.**

## Readjusting camera brightness

If you wish to change the brightness, simply **untighten the extended pin at #2** and **rotate #1**

## Readjusting camera focus

If you wish to change the focus, simply **untighten the extended pin at #3** and **rotate #2**

:::warning Warning
Never loosen the camera lens from the camera module for the sake of focusing as the lens may fall out of the device, causing damage.
