# Camera and Lens Configuration

## Testing your camera

First, remove the lens cap from the XIMI camera module.

To test your camera, tap on the **Test Cam** button. You should see the image your camera is currently capturing.

## Lens Adjustment: Exposure and Focus

If you see a blank image, ensure that the lens cap is taken off. If the image is still blank, consider this troubleshooting solution: [Camera fails to turn on after OS upgrade](/docs/user-manual/performers/troubleshooting/camera/camera-doesnt-turn-on-after-os-upgrade).

The camera lens should come with two dials: one for **focusing**, and one for controlling the **exposure**. **Due to the complexity of how the lens work, it is recommended to follow through the next set of instructions step-by-step to avoid confusion.**

Here is a reference image for the instructions below.

Note: If your unit do not have any **extended pins**, please [contact us here](/docs/help-problem).

If your unit have **only 1 extended pin**, you can use it to **lock the exposure dial**, as it is preferable to lock the exposure dial to make it easier to rotate the focus dial. If required, remove and insert the pin into the threaded hole where the **Pin that LOCKS EXPOSURE** is supposed to be.

:::info Note

Before adjusting the dials, ensure that the **locking pins** are **untightened (but not removed from the lens)**. This ensures that you are able to rotate the dials easily.
:::

### Exposure

Locate the dial that is responsible for **exposure** (see the **yellow section** labelled **"Dial that CONTROLS EXPOSURE"** in the reference image)

Adjust the exposure to get the desired brightness you require for your performance. Lock the dial in place by **tightening** the **extended pin** found 1 level before the dial (see the **yellow arrow** labelled **"Pin that LOCKS EXPOSURE"** in the reference image)

:::tip Note
If you find it hard to adjust the dial, **try loosening the extended knob and try again.**

### Focus

**Ensure that the exposure dial is locked before you begin focusing.** This is to ensure that you do not accidentally adjust the exposure. If you have not done so, please refer to the [Exposure section](/docs/user-manual/performers/lens-setup#exposure).

Locate the dial responsible for the **focus** adjustment (see the **cyan arrow** labelled **"Dial that CONTROLS FOCUS"** in the reference image above)

To adjust the camera's focus, turn the dial **clockwise** to focus on further objects, and **anti-clockwise** to focus on nearer objects. Adjust until you see a sharp image.

If you encounter any issues with the camera lens, please go to the [Troubleshooting Camera Lens page](/docs/user-manual/performers/troubleshooting/camera/unable-to-rotate-camera-lens) to read more.

:::warning Warning
Never loosen the camera lens from the camera module for the sake of focusing as the lens may fall out of the device, causing damage.
