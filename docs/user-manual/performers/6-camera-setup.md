# Setting Up Your Camera

## Set Up

The camera is mounted at the top of the unit. It should be capped by the lens cover to prevent damage to the sensor. Remove the cap only when you need to use the unit.

Take note to remove the **grooved ring** that is attached between the lens cap and the camera module as well. This is a **C-CS-mount Adaptor** which is not needed for our set up.

Uncap your lens cap and mount the camera lens onto the camera module. Be sure to tighten the lens all the way into the camera module.

## Testing your camera

To test your camera, tap on the **Test Cam** button. You should see the image your camera is currently capturing.

If you see a blank image, ensure that the lens cap is taken off. If the image is still blank, consider this troubleshooting solution: [Camera fails to turn on after OS upgrade](/docs/user-manual/performers/troubleshooting/camera-doesnt-turn-on-after-os-upgrade).

Otherwise, read on to learn how to adjust the camera.
