# Using the XIMI Child Node Software

## Joining a room

Tap on the **refresh** icon to see what rooms are available. In this example, there is a room called `jackfruit-olive`. Tap on the room name to join that room. You will need the passcode set by your stage manager.

<!-- ![](/img/new-user-manual/child-raspi/15-testaudio.png)

Enter the passcode when prompted:

If your passcode was correct, you will be prompted to enter your nickname. This is limited to 5 characters maximum.

:::note

It is important to stick to the same nickname throughout the show, for example if you have to leave the room and re-join. This is so that whatever controls the stage manager applies from their end will stay applied to your unit.

:::warning

Do not choose the same nickname as another performer as this will cause stage manager controls to stop working.

# Performing

Once you're in the room, turn on your mic and camera with the buttons here.

You can hide the buttons if you don't need them:

## During performance

The stage manager will control what you see on your video. You will also be able to see who you can hear (also controlled by the stage manager), so you only hear information relevant to you at any point in the performance.
