# Connecting to Wi-Fi

Although not ideal, the Child Node is able to perform over Wi-Fi connection as well, with no additional hardware needed.(A wired Ethernet network connection is the most ideal)

:::tip

If performing over Wi-Fi, try to be as close to your wireless router as possible.

:::

If the Wi-Fi icon has a red cross over it, click on it and select **Turn on Wi-Fi**.
