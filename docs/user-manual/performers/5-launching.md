# Launching XIMI Child Node Software

Once your gear is all set up and configured, it's time to start performing!

The Child Node comes to life through the Child Node software. It is currently codenamed "Argos Child" in the beta phase, but will be updated in the near future. To launch this software, double-tap on the Argos icon on the desktop.

In the dialog that pops up, select **Execute**.

Alternatively, launch the **Web Browser** with this icon, and navigate to `https://argos-child.vercel.app` (to be updated past testing phase). You can use the browser to navigate if that is available on your unit:

You will see an interface similar to the one here:
