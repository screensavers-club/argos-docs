# Configuring Audio With PulseAudio Volume Control

The PulseAudio Volume Control is very useful in managing your audio devices when you have multiple audio devices plugged in.

## Setting up

First, enter a room in XIMI and turn on your audio. If there is no room to connect to, you can visit any video streaming sites like Youtube and play a video with sound.

If you are in fullscreen mode, exit fullscreen mode by placing your finger on the top of the screen and sliding down, then press the "X" that appears.

Go to Menu > Sound & Video > PulseAudio Volume Control to begin.
