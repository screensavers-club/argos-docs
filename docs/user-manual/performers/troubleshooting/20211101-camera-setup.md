# Setting Up Your Camera

## Set Up

The camera is mounted at the top of the unit. It should be capped by the lens cover to prevent damage to the sensor. Remove the cap only when you need to use the unit.

Take note to remove the **grooved ring** that is attached between the lens cap and the camera module as well. This is a **C-CS-mount Adaptor** which is not needed for our set up.

Uncap your lens cap and mount the camera lens onto the camera module. Be sure to tighten the lens all the way into the camera module.
