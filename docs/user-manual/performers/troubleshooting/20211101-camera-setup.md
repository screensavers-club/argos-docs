# Setting up the camera correctly / troubleshooting blurry camera

## Set Up

The camera is mounted at the top of the unit. It should be capped by the lens cover to prevent damage to the sensor. Remove the cap only when you need to use the unit.

Take note to remove the **grooved ring** that is attached between the lens cap and the camera module as well. This is a **C-CS-mount Adaptor** which is not needed for our set up.

Uncap your lens cap and mount the camera lens onto the camera module.

## Aperture

The camera lens should come with two dials: one for **focusing**, and one for controlling the **aperture** (exposure). Locate the dial that is responsible for **aperture** before starting on focusing.

Adjust the aperture to get the desired exposure. Lock the dial in place by tightening the **extended knob** found on the dial. You may proceed to focusing the image after finishing this step.

## Focus

To adjust the camera's focus, turn the knob **clockwise** to focus on further objects, and **anti-clockwise** to focus on nearer objects.

You can use the **Test Camera** function in the XIMI application to test the camera's focus.
