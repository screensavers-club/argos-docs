# Installing Bluetooth on the XIMI Child Node

The Child Node has hardware support for Bluetooth, but it needs to be activated separately.

:::tip

It's easier to do this with a keyboard and mouse attached.

:::

Launch the Terminal application, and type in the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install bluetooth pi-bluetooth bluez blueman
```

Then press `Enter`. Press `y` followed by `Enter` to confirm that you want to install the above.

Upon completion of installation, you should see the Bluetooth icon appear on the top-right corner of your screen.
