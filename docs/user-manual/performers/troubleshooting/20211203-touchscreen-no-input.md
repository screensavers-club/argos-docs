# Touchscreen Not Registering Input After Configuring Bluetooth

This issue pertains to users not able to click onto the **Raspberry Pi Menu**, the **Desktop Icons**, and the top right **System Icons**. This usually happens after the user opens the **Bluetooth dropdown menu**.

---

## How does this issue happen

This issue happens when click onto the **Bluetooth Icon**, then exit the dropdown menu without performing any action.

## How to fix this issue

To fix it, open the same **Bluetooth Icon** and click **Help**

A popup will showup. Simple move the popup menu around the screen and close it afterwards. It does not matter how much the popup is being moved.

The bug will then be fixed and you can now access **Raspberry Pi Menu**, **Desktop Icons**, and the **System Icons**.

This is a very strange solution and as such is our current workaround for this issue. We are still looking for a more permanent fix to this issue.

For now, **avoid clicking the Bluetooth icon** unless you really need to access it.
