# Audio Configuration

You can use multiple audio devices simultaneously. E.g. a USB microphone for **input**, together with a pair of earphones connected to the on-board 3.5mm jack for **output**.

There are two methods of configuring your audio.

---

## Option 1: Using PulseAudio Volume Control

### Setting up

First, enter a room in XIMI and turn on your audio. If there is no room to connect to, you can visit any video streaming sites like Youtube and play a video with sound.

If you are in fullscreen mode, exit fullscreen mode by placing your finger on the top of the screen and sliding down, then press the "X" that appears.

Go to Menu > Sound & Video > PulseAudio Volume Control to begin.

## Audio Output Settings

A window will appear. Go to "Playback". You should see "Chromium", which is the web browser.

Once you have configured the devices, you may close the window.

## Option 2: Using System Audio Config

You will need a mouse connected to the XIMI Child Node for this operation.

After your hardware is connected, **right-click** on the speaker icon on the top right of the screen. You will be able to select connected devices for **Audio Output** and **Audio Input** separately.
