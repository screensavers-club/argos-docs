# Connecting Accessories

## USB and Wired Ethernet

The XIMI Child Node comes with 4 USB (USB-A) ports to plug in accessories, including keyboards, mice, microphones and headphones.

There is also an Ethernet jack that enables the Child Node to connect to the internet via a wired connection. This will give the best network performance.
