:::warning Note

If you are swapping out or installing the camera lens, please check if the **C-CS Adaptor** is attached onto the camera. Check if your lens require this adaptor before installation as it will cause focusing issues.

Please check this [issue](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=276558) and this [documentation](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/product-guides/Typical_C-Mount_Lens_Guide.pdf) to understand more about this issue.

2. Attach the power cable onto the **Raspberry Pi** via the **USB C port**

3. Plug the power plug into an inlet to power the **Raspberry Pi**

:::tip Note
Be careful to not remove or attach any wiring while the device is powered as it may cause short circuit which may damage the components. If you have to re-configure any wiring, please shut down and unplug the Raspberry Pi before doing so. Please note that this does not apply when switching camera lenses.

4. The Child Node Unit should boot up. Wait until you see the desktop.

5. At the top left of the unit, click the **globe icon**. This will launch the web browser, **Chromium**.

6. On the main screen, you should see an icon labelled **Argos Child**. Click it to enter the Child Software.

7. Alternatively, you may type in the URL: `https://argos-child.vercel.app/`. To do this, you will need to either **plug in a keyboard** or use the on-screen keyboard via clicking the `Raspberry Pi Icon` on the top left of the top bar, then clicking `Accessories` > `Keyboard`.
