# Stream Controls

## Audio Control

Stream Controls allow you to control which performers (Child Nodes) each Child Node can hear. Within each tile representing a Node, toggle the audio for each performer by clicking on <VolumeLoud /> / <VolumeOff />.

You will also be able to see whether each Child Node is sending audio (<Microphone />) and video (<Film />).

## Audio Presets

Use the <Download /> button to save the settings you have configured into the respective slots.
Use the <Upload /> button to load and apply the settings previously saved.
These settings will apply across all Child Nodes present in the Room.
