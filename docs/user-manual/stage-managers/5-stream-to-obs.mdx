# Streaming to OBS

After your performers are all set up, you are now ready to feed their audio and video into OBS Studio for the actual livestream.

## Getting stream link

First, get the **stream link** of the Child Node you would like to add to OBS Studio.

Regardless of whether the Child Node is broadcasting audio and/or video, you are able to choose whether the Child Node stream will include audio.

## Adding stream to OBS

Launch OBS. Under **Sources** panel, click the + icon and select **Browser Source**.

Name your source accordingly to organise your scene better. We recommend naming it the nickname of the Child Node you're adding.

- Paste in the **stream link** you copied from the **Stream Control** page on the Parent Node.
- Set the `width` and `height` as desired. The video source will find a best fit to fill up the frame.
- For better efficiency on OBS end, set the `FPS` value to 30.
