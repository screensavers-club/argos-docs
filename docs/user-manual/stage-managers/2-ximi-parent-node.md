# XIMI Parent Node Software

Stage managers use the **XIMI Parent Node Software** to start a **Room** for performers to join. To get started, navigate to `https://argos-parent.vercel.app` using **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com)** web browser. Other browsers are currently not supported.

## Creating a Room

You will see this interface at https://argos-parent.vercel.app . To start a Room, click **Create room**.

A room name will be generated automatically for you. You may re-roll the room name to get a new randomly generated name. Set a passcode **up to 5 numbers long**. Only numbers are supported as this enables Child Nodes to [enter the passcode easily](/docs/user-manual/performers/usage#joining-a-room) with their touchscreen interface.

Once the Room is created, you will see this interface. You can now share the room name and passcode with performers for them to join with their Child Node.

When Child Nodes join the Room, they will be shown on the interface. In this case, `XIMI1` has joined the Room.

Another user `XIMI2` joins the Room.

## Joining a Room

You may also join an existing Room with the Parent Node software to control Child Nodes. We recommend using only one computer to be the Parent Node at any one time as the state of the Room usually gets very confusing if multiple people are using the same controls at the same time.

To join existing Rooms, just tap on the room name and enter the passcode, similar to the workflow for the Child Node.
