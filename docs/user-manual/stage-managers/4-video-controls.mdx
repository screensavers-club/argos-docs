# Video Controls

From the Parent Node software, you are able to control what each performer sees on their Child Node interface.

## Select Child Node

Select the Child Node whose layout you want to change. As you make changes, the small icon next to the Child Node name represents its current layout.

## Select layout and subject

Select a layout you would like to apply to the selected Child Node.

Upon selecting a layout, you will be able to select which performers to show on each tile in the layout.

Your selections will update immediately on the Child Node's screen.

:::info

- The <img src="/img/new-user-manual/parent/layout-default.svg" alt="Default Layout" style={{width: '24px'}} /> icon is work-in-progress and currently does not change the layout
- Custom Layouts are currently work-in-progress and will be available in next updates

:::tip

With performers who have short nicknames, the "Select performer" function on each tile could be hard to click. Try clicking on the left corner of the control. A bug fix will be applied shortly.
