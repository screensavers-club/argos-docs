# Overview

XIMI is a combination of hardware and software that comes together to facilitate seamless livestream performance over the Internet.

The main advantages of XIMI are:

- Performers can see and hear each other with minimal delay. Compared to leveraging Skype or Zoom, where video and audio has to travel to a server and back, XIMI allows video and audio to reach the recipient directly through WebRTC
- Stage manager can control what performers see and hear individually, and change up the mix live (e.g. for different scenes in a performance)
- Performer (Child Nodes) streams are captured individually into OBS, allowing for fine grain layout control even for performances that happen across the Internet (as opposed to Zoom/Skype, where the layout is preset from the conferencing software)
