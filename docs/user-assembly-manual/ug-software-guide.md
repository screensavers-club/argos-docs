2. Next, check if there are any available rooms to join on the left. If there isn't, it means that there are no rooms created by the **Parent Node**. In this case, you may click the **Refresh** button to refresh the room list when there is a room that is ready to join.

3. You may test your camera input by clicking **Test Cam** before you join any room. This is not visible to other users.

5. Once you are ready, click onto the room you wish to join. You will enter the **Enter Password** page.

6. Type in the password given by your host. **The password should have a maximum length of 5 digits.**

7. Click **Enter** to enter the room. If your password is wrong, the **input bar will shake**, indicating an error in your entry. You may clear the field using the **Cancel** button on the bottom left, or delete your input the **Backspace** button on the bottom right.

8. If your password is correct, you will enter the **Enter Nickname** page. **You can enter a maximum of 5 characters here.** and you **must enter at least 1 character** before moving onto the next page.

9. Once in the room, you may click the **Microphone** icon to toggle your **mic input**, and the **Camera** icon to toggle your **video input**. A green dot indicates that it is **On**.
