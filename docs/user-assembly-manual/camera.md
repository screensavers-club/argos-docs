1. Start by lightly screwing the `1/4" Tripod Adaptor Screw` onto the bottom of the camera. (Just two to three turns will be enough)

:::warning Fragile!
Make sure the ribbon cable is correctly aligned with the contacts before pushing down the black tab to avoid damaging the cable. Do not force the ribbon cable with excessive force.
