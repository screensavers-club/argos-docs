:::tip Note
Place the models in ways which generates the least amount of supports.

:::tip Speed of Print
The speed of the print went along well with our printer's default settings. It worked for us, so this may be applicable to other printers. We could even increase the print speed up to 140% via the printer settings and there seems to be no side effects -- as of now.
